- 👋 Hey:), I’m @bakk21 or also Kevin.
- 👀 I’m interested in game developing and some other things like java or php.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking my time learning backend, starting with node + React using Vite from 0 to a decent level.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, someday, and app and/or web developing.
- 📫 How to reach me? A message is just enough!, though i'd like to be ready first.
